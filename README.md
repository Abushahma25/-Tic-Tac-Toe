# -Tic-Tac-Toe
This web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers two modes of gameplay: Player vs Player (2-player mode) and Player vs AI. In the 2-player mode, two users take turns placing their markers (X and O) on a 3Ã—3 grid. In AI mode, the player competes against a basic AI that makes random valid moves.
